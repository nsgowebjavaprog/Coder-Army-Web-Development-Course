  <h3>Introduction: </h3>Dive into the world of web development by first unlocking the secrets of
  how the internet truly works.
  This course kicks off with a powerful introduction to the web,
  guiding learners through the invisible highways where data travels—from protocols and packets
  to the core concept of IP addresses. You'll discover how websites are accessed, who assigns IPs,
  and why DNS (Domain Name System) is the backbone of online navigation. 
  As the journey continues, the course unpacks MAC addresses, port numbers, and the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, 
  making complex networking topics feel intuitive. You'll explore the roles of switches, routers, and modern networking hardware, 
  gaining insight into public vs. private IPs and the power of VPNs. 
  Then, the spotlight shifts to web development itself—covering essential tools, frameworks, and the 
  MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). 
  By the end, you'll not only understand what a full-stack developer does, but you'll be ready to start building dynamic,
  modern web applications with confidence.
