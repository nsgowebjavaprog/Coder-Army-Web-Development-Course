    <h3>1: The Basics - Getting a Video on the Page</h3>
    <p>The star of the show is the <b>video</b> tag. At its simplest, it just needs to know the source of the video file.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>code Html</li>
        <li>downloadcontent_copy</li>
        <li>expand_less</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2: Intermediate - Gaining More Control with Attributes</h3>
    <p>Now that we have a player, how do we control its behavior and appearance? We use attributes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>width and height</b>: Just like with an <b>img</b> tag, you can set the dimensions of the player. code Html</li>
        <li>downloadcontent_copy</li>
        <li>expand_less</li>
        <li>IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START</li>
        <li>IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3: The <b>audio</b> Tag</h3>
    <p>The good news is that the <audio> tag works almost identically to the <video> tag, just without the visual component.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Problem</b>: How do we embed a sound file (like a song or a podcast) with player controls?</li>
            <li><b>The Solution</b>: Use the <b>audio</b> tag with the controls attribute.</li>
        </ul>
